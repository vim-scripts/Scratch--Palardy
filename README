Short (< 50 lines) plugin to create scratch buffers.

Scratch buffers are used to create new commands:

* ScratchDiff ... compare current buffer against new scratch
* ScratchFind ... runs a "find" command and outputs result in a new scratch

ScratchFind is used to emulate most of the functionality of command-t in TextMate.

Configure ScratchFind's behavior with the g:scratch_find_command variable.
